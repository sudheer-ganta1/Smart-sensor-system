# Smart-sensor-system
I designed and built a smart indoor air quality monitoring system using an Arduino and sensors for temperature, humidity, CO2, and VOCs. I programmed Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to send real-time data to mobile devices and created a user-friendly interface with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for seamless data visualization and monitoring.
